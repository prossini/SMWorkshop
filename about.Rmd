Hi! I'm a [Senior Lecturer in Communication, Media & Democracy at the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/staff/patriciarossini/). Prior to joining UofG, I was an inaugural Derby Fellow in the Department of Communication and Media at the University of Liverpool (2019-22), and a post-doctoral researcher at the School of Information Studies (iSchool) at Syracuse University (2017-19). I received my Ph.D. in 2017, from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 

Broadly speaking, I study the interplay between political communication and technologies, with a focus on digital threats to democracyâ€”specifically, uncivil and intolerant online discourse, mis- and disinformation, as well as (dark) participation, democratic backsliding, and online campaigns. My research uses mixed-methods, ranging from core social-scientific methodologies such as surveys, experiments, and content analysis, to computational methods.
